# Config-Files
Configuration files for different Linux-y things
The pupose of this github is to learn how to use git, improve CLI ability, and learn more about making, managing, and modifying different configuration files. All code hosted on this page will be initiated from other sources that fall under opensource MIT or GPL licenses. I am not a programmer, so any configuration files found here should be verified before installing on your own system. User discretion is advised. Licensing is directly related to the source code used to compile each package and can be found in the package directory. Any feedback is welcome, if you have any tips or tricks please let me know!
If you see errors in my config files please let me know. It may help me keep from borking my system too!
